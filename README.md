# WebScrappers
This is a repository containing web scrappers for SLDC websites of Madhya Pradesh. <br>

The web scrapper uses Python libraries BeautifulSoup, requests and Selenium. The WebScrapper takes the SLDC url as input link and checks the available download links on that url. On the url, on clicking the download links it triggers a JavaScript code which initiates the file download. To automate this action Selenium library was used and it successfully automated this task. From this project, the key learning part was how the selenium library works and had hands on implementation for BeautifulSoup and webscrapping.
